### **Motivation and Questions**   
I originally started this project wanting to shed a light on black-owned businesses and the types of businesses in predominantly black communities. As I dug deeper into the data, I found out black-owned businesses make up only 7.9% of all businesses in Davidson County. I also came across a lot of literature about what’s being called “The Great Resignation” – people quitting their jobs and either entering new jobs/fields or going into business for themselves. I found that 4.3 million business applications were filed in 2020, which is the most that have been filed in a decade and a half. In Davidson County alone, 12,753 applications were filed, up about 18.5% from 2019. So, I thought, instead of focusing on only Black-Owned businesses in Black communities, I’d analyze data on the types of businesses in these communities and use that to create a dashboard for community members to see what types of businesses are in their communities.
